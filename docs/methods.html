                    <p>These are the final animations produced for the Erie Insurance Dictionary Page. The animations produced describe two terms chosen from our list, <b>Claims/Claims Adjuster</b> and <b>Umbrella Insurance</b>.</p>
                    <p>Instead of using GIFs, each animation is in a .MP4 file format that is looping and muted. MP4s ensure the animations are visually clear while reducing overall load times.</p>

                <div class="pcont">
                    <p>The project was created using several programs and applications. Our two insurance terms took different approaches in the methods they would be animated.</p>
                    <p>The <b>Claims/Claims Adjuster</b> wireframes, storyboard, and animation were all created using <a href="https://flipaclip.com/">FlipaClip</a>, a 2D animation software designed for frame-by-frame animation. Each frame of the animation was hand drawn.</p>
                    <p>The <b>Umbrella Insurance</b> wireframes and early drafts were created with FlipaClip. The final "poster-like" image was converted to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> as an SVG, and animated using <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html">Adobe After Effects</a>.</p>

                    <img src="images/ClaimandClaimAdjusterSketches.png" alt="Six wireframe scenes for describing the terms 'Claim' and 'Claim Adjuster.' Each scene describes progression of a story. In the first panel a woman is driving before entering a car crash. She calls a claim adjuster to create a claim and resolve her issue.">

                </div>
                <div class="pcont">
                    <p>Each wireframe sketch was developed using FlipaClip, and served as the foundation for drafts and final animations.</p>
                </div>

                    <img style="width: 400px; height: unset;" src="images/ExtraLiabilityProtection.png" alt="Beginning poster of Umbrella Insurance for Erie insurance. An umbrella top in the middle of the poster lists the definition of umbrella insurance. The umbrella acts as protection from large raindrops that say 'Property Damage Claims' and 'Personal Injury.'" />
                    <img style="width: 400px; height: unset;" src="images/UmbrellaInsuranceDraft.jpg" alt="Final draft of the animation layout for Umbrella Insurance. Decriptive text has been relocated to the bottom right infront of a large blue puddle. Apart from some rearranging, most elements have been kept the same." />
                </div>
                <div class="pcont">
                    <p>The final draft of the Umbrella Insurance animation keeps a lot of elements listed fromt the wireframe and drafts. Throughout the drafts, the defining text, focus words, and some elements such as the home and family have moved. The sizes of the family and house were increased and moved centerwise to provide more emphasis.</p> 
                    <p>Little has been added or removed throughout the iterations. The quality of the original wireframes and drafts were well enough that the term was understandable. The most added has been an umbrella cane and a puddle to serve as a dark background for text. </p>
